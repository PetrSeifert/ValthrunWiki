Valthrun is an open source external Counter-Strike 2 read only kernel-level gameplay enhancer.  
That's a lot of descriptive words, but what does each of them mean?

- `Valthrun` The name of this project
- `open source` This application is open source and for everyone to learn from
- `external` We do not inject any DLLs into the target process
- `read only` We do not write to the CS2 process in any way, therefore being impossible to detect by scanning the process memory
- `kernel` We do not use any user level WinAPIs in order to get information from the CS2 process

This project is mainly a fun example for exploring the Windows Kernel with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and exploring the world of game enhancements :)

:::warning
Valthrun is **not** a plug 'n play solution.  
Instead Valthrun aims to achieve maximum stealth and stay invisible for other applications.  
Please read [Getting started](../getting-started/) carefully and try to troubleshooting issues on your own.
