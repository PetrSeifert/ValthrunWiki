## Prerequiresits

Before you can use the CS2 ingame overlay you have to optain the following prerequiresits:

1. Download the CS2 ingame overlay (controller.exe)
   Download the latest CS2 ingame overlay (contained within CS2 Enhancements) from the Valthrun Homepage:
   https://valth.run/download

2. Setup one of the Valthrun drivers  
   How you can setup a Valthrun driver is described in detail in the [drivers section](../../../drivers/implementation).  
   The CS2 ingame overlay requires a Valthrun driver to be successfully loaded.

## Setup

Once a Valthrun driver has been successfully loaded, and CS2 is up and running,
you can start the Valthrun overlay by running `controller.exe`.
If everything is set up correctly, you should see a terminal window looking like this:

With these steps completed, you are now ready to use Valthrun and take advantage of its gameplay enhancements for Counter-Strike 2.
You can access the overlay by pressing the `PAUSE` key. If you do not have such key please refer to [Open the GUI without a PAUSE key](./troubleshooting/pause_key)

## Usage along with Faceit

It is possible to use the Valthrun CS2 in-game overlay along with the Zenith driver for Faceit, but it is not recommended. Using the overlay while playing Counter Strike 2 on Faceit might result in your account being flagged due to potential violations of Faceitâ€™s policies.

A possible solution to retain all the functionalities of the overlay without actually overlaying the game might be developed in the future. This would allow users to benefit from the features without risking detection.
