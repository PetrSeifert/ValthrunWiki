# What is the Valthrun Zenith Driver

The Valthrun Zenith Driver is designed to read from and write to arbitrary physical or virtual memory while being completely transparent to the Windows operating system. By using the Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) feature of Windows the Zenith migrates against typical OS-level detection mechanisms.

However, the Zenith Driver by itself is not useful; it requires an application to leverage its capabilities. Applications using the Zenith Driver can read and write to arbitrary Windows process and kernel memory, gaining deep insights into their state. This allows for deep introspection of your PC's memory without leaving any traces of such activities.

### Warning

While the Valthrun Zenith Driver has been specifically designed to be as evasive as possible, it is important to note that no system or software can be guaranteed to remain completely undetectable in all circumstances. In particular, any applications—especially those running in user mode and utilizing the Valthrun Zenith Driver—could potentially be traced if specifically targeted by advanced detection techniques.
