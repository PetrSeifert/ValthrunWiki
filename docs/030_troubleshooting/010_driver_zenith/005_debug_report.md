# Create debug report

If you encounter issues with the Zenith Driver, please contact our [Discord Support Team](../../../general/discord). To assist you effectively, you may need to provide a debug report generated by the Zenith Installer.

## Generate the Debug Report

1. Run the Zenith Installer as administrator.
2. Select the option: `Collect System Debug Info`.
3. The installer will create a file named `vtz-debug-info.zip`, containing all necessary system information for troubleshooting.

## Contents of the Debug Report

The debug report includes all data available through msinfo32, such as your PC username.
It also contains files from your Windows operating system related to the Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) feature. These files are purely technical and do not include any of your personal data, so there is no need to worry.
