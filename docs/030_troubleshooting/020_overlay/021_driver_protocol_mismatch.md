# Driver Protocol Mismatch

## What this means

This error occurs when there is a mismatch between the protocol used by the Valthrun application and the driver it’s trying to work with. Essentially, the application and driver are speaking different "versions" of the language they need to communicate, so they can't work together correctly.

## How to fix

Ensure that both the Valthrun application and the driver are updated to their latest versions. Outdated versions are often incompatible with each other. If updating doesn’t work, uninstall the driver, download the correct version from the official Valthrun site, and reinstall it.
