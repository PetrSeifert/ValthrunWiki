# Getting started

Welcome to the Valthrun project!  
  
To get up and running quickly, it's recommend to begin with the [Architectural overview](./010_architechture.md). This article provides a comprehensive explanation of Valthrunâ€™s core components and how they interact, giving you the foundational knowledge to get started.

If you prefer a more streamlined setup process, you can use the Valthrun Loader, a tool designed to help you get started with minimal manual configuration. Instructions for using the loader can be found in the [Quickstart via Valthrun Loader](./020_loader.md) guide.
